## Usage

1. **Add Content**:
   - Write your site content in Markdown and save it in the `content/` directory as `index.md`.
   - Use subdirectories to organize your pages, for example, you can save your content in subdirectories like `content/dragons/index.md`.

2. **Customize the Template**:
   - Edit the `template.html` file to modify the site's layout.

3. **Run the Generator**:
   ```bash
   python src/main.py
   ```

4. **View Output**:
   - The generated site will be saved in the `public/` directory. Open `public/index.html` in your browser to preview.

5. **Quick Run** (optional):
   - Use the shell script for streamlined execution:
     ```bash
     ./main.sh
     ```
   - This will run `src/main.py` and set up a local server on `http://localhost:8888`.
